# Toxic Website (Mark Calculator)

## What is this?

Toxic site, or Mark Calculator, is a website that help check how much you really need to get on your final exam to pass the course. This website is toxic since it promotes bad habits. If you are someone who procrastinates, finds excuses to not do work, or is generally lazy, this might not be the "inspirational" tool you are looking for. 

## Technology used

This website is one of my first times using Vite.js to develop a website. This was the best middle ground for the website as there aren't any complex animated parts of the website that would require a framework like Vue or React, but might require the utility of hot reloads and build tools. The website uses vanilla HTML, JS and CSS.
